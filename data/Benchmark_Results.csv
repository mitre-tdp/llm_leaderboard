            Context: On March 18, 2008 approximately 1045 mountain daylight time, a Robinson R22 beta, M3056T, registered to Pacific Rim Aviation, Lafayette, Colorado, and operated by Premier Helicopters, Broomfield, Colorado, was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain following a loss of rotor rpm during a practice autorotation at Las Vegas Municipal Airport (LVS), Las Vegas, New Mexico. Visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed at the time of the accident. The cross-country instructional flight was being conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 without a flight plan. The commercial certificated flight instructor and student pilot on board the helicopter were not injured. The flight originated at Raton, New Mexico, at 0900, and was en route to Las Vegas, New Mexico.

According to the instructor's accident report, they checked both the terminal forecast (TAF) and the Automated Weather Observation Station (AWOS) for LVS. Both reported the wind to be from 020 degrees, but the TAF reported wind velocity to be 10 knots, whereas AWOS reported it to be 15 knots with gusts to 20 knots. As the helicopter approached the airport, the student told the instructor he would like to practice a 180 degree autorotation. The maneuver was begun from 1,000 feet agl (above ground level), but due to poor rpm and speed control, the instructor assumed control of the helicopter and advised the student he would demonstrate the proper technique. The instructor said he kept the rpm 'in the green' and kept the airspeed above 65 knots, but realized the helicopter was descending 'at an unusually high rate of descent.' As he rolled out to level, 'it felt as if we had a huge downdraft that was pushing us towards the ground.' The instructor added throttle and began to 'pull all the power available.' Lift was not sufficient to overcome the descent rate. Just prior to impact, the pilot applied slight aft cyclic control. The helicopter struck the ground, bounced, and continued to fly with some forward momentum. The instructor then landed the helicopter. Post-impact inspection revealed the skids were spread, the engine mounts were bent, and part of the pilot's window had popped out. The instructor said that at no time did the LOW ROTOR RPM horn sound.

            Context: On March 4, 2008, about 1630 Alaska standard time, a Bell 206L helicopter, N404EH, sustained substantial damage when it collided with terrain, following a loss of control while maneuvering, about 59 miles southeast of Nikolai, Alaska. The helicopter was being operated by the pilot as a visual flight rules (VFR) aerial photography flight under Title 14, CFR Part 91, when the accident occurred. The commercial certificated pilot and sole passenger received minor injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed.

During a telephone conversation with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC) on March 5, the pilot said he was maneuvering the helicopter while his passenger filmed a dogsled race, when the helicopter impacted terrain. He said there were no preimpact mechanical anomalies with the helicopter. The helicopter received structural damage to the fuselage and rotor system during the collision with terrain.

In a written statement dated March 13, the pilot reported that he was flying along slowly, and a gust of wind caused a loss of tail rotor effectiveness. He said the helicopter started to turn to the right, and he reduced collective pitch and followed the turn to regain control. During the maneuver he said he was losing altitude and approaching terrain. He said a second gust caused a further loss of tail rotor effectiveness, and as the helicopter rotated, the tail rotor struck a tree, and the helicopter impacted the ground.

The helicopter was not examined by the NTSB.

The helicopter struck the ground, bounced, and continued to fly with some forward momentum. The instructor then landed the helicopter. Post-impact inspection revealed the skids were spread, the engine mounts were bent, and part of the pilot's window had popped out. The instructor said that at no time did the LOW ROTOR RPM horn sound.

Output: [M3056T]

Context: The pilot of a Robinson R44 II was on the final leg of a VFR flight when he received a special VFR clearance due to snow showers. This clearance was later canceled due to 'saturation,' and the pilot was instructed not to enter the area. The pilot turned the helicopter around, entering a 'near zero/zero whiteout,' during which the attitude indicator 'tumbled.' Opting for a precautionary landing in a plowed field, the helicopter hit the ground, causing the skids to sink into the soft terrain and the tailboom and skids to separate from the fuselage. The weather at the destination airport reported 1 1/2 statute miles visibility in light snow and mist.

Context: On October 17, 2018, a Robinson R22 Beta helicopter, N923SH, crashed near Fulton, Missouri, during a solo instructional flight, destroying the aircraft. The pilot, training for his rotorcraft-helicopter rating, was flying solo from Moscow Mills, Missouri, to Columbia Regional Airport, performing touch-and-go landings. The helicopter departed Moscow Mills around 1345 and crashed 36 minutes later en route to COU. Witnesses reported the helicopter losing altitude and spinning in a downward spiral, with no distress calls from the pilot. The pilot had a rotorcraft endorsement for solo flight in the R22 helicopter. The helicopter had 28 gallons of fuel onboard at departure, with the manufacturer indicating a consumption rate of 7-10 gallons per hour. The atmospheric conditions were conducive to moderate to serious icing. The wreckage was found in a grassy area near Fulton, MO, with evidence of a nose-low, left-skid-down impact.

Context: The pilot was conducting a night agricultural flight when an aggressive collective application during takeoff caused the engine to sputter and the RPMs to drop. Despite efforts to regain RPMs by lowering the collective, the helicopter descended and moved forward. The pilot applied aft cyclic to halt forward movement and attempted a landing. The left skid hit soft dirt, causing the main rotor blades to strike the tailboom as the pilot tried to prevent a nose-over. The helicopter rolled forward, spun left, and came to rest on its left side, causing substantial damage to the fuselage, tail rotor drive system, and skid tubes. The pilot admitted rushing the operation and confirmed no mechanical issues that would have hindered normal operation.

Output: [NONE]

            Context: On a sunny afternoon, a small Cessna aircraft took off from the local airport for a routine training flight. The pilot, a seasoned instructor with over 20 years of experience, was accompanied by a student on his first flight. The weather was clear, with a light breeze coming from the west. The aircraft climbed steadily, reaching an altitude of 3000 feet. The instructor demonstrated a series of maneuvers, including turns, climbs, and descents. The student, eager to learn, watched closely and asked questions. After about an hour, the aircraft returned to the airport and landed safely.

            Context: On March 4, 2008, about 1630 Alaska standard time, a Bell 206L helicopter, N404EH, sustained substantial damage when it collided with terrain, following a loss of control while maneuvering, about 59 miles southeast of Nikolai, Alaska. The helicopter was being operated by the pilot as a visual flight rules (VFR) aerial photography flight under Title 14, CFR Part 91, when the accident occurred. The commercial certificated pilot and sole passenger received minor injuries. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed, and no flight plan was filed.

During a telephone conversation with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigator-in-charge (IIC) on March 5, the pilot said he was maneuvering the helicopter while his passenger filmed a dogsled race, when the helicopter impacted terrain. He said there were no preimpact mechanical anomalies with the helicopter. The helicopter received structural damage to the fuselage and rotor system during the collision with terrain.

In a written statement dated March 13, the pilot reported that he was flying along slowly, and a gust of wind caused a loss of tail rotor effectiveness. He said the helicopter started to turn to the right, and he reduced collective pitch and followed the turn to regain control. During the maneuver he said he was losing altitude and approaching terrain. He said a second gust caused a further loss of tail rotor effectiveness, and as the helicopter rotated, the tail rotor struck a tree, and the helicopter impacted the ground.

The helicopter was not examined by the NTSB.

During the maneuver he said he was losing altitude and approaching terrain. He said a second gust caused a further loss of tail rotor effectiveness, and as the helicopter rotated, the tail rotor struck a tree, and the helicopter impacted the ground.

The helicopter was not examined by the NTSB.

            Context: According to the pilot of the Robinson R44 II, he was on the final leg of a visual flight rules (VFR) flight. About 18 miles from the destination airport, the pilot obtained a special VFR clearance from the approach controller due to snow showers in the area. The clearance was later canceled by the controller due to 'saturation,' and the pilot was told not to enter the area, which was several miles ahead. The pilot then turned the helicopter around and entered a 'near zero/zero whiteout,' but during the 'tight' turn the attitude indicator 'tumbled.' The pilot then elected to perform a precautionary landing to a plowed field below. As the helicopter contacted the ground, the skids sunk into the soft terrain, and the aft portion of the tailboom and the skids separated from the fuselage. The weather reported at the destination airport at the time of the accident included 1 1/2 statute miles visibility in light snow and mist.

Context: On a sunny afternoon, a small Cessna aircraft took off from the local airport for a routine training flight. The pilot, a seasoned instructor with over 20 years of experience, was accompanied by a student on his first flight. The weather was clear, with a light breeze coming from the west. The aircraft climbed steadily, reaching an altitude of 3000 feet. The instructor demonstrated a series of maneuvers, including turns, climbs, and descents. The student, eager to learn, watched closely and asked questions. After about an hour, the aircraft returned to the airport and landed safely. The student was thrilled with his first flight and looked forward to his next lesson.

Context: On March 18, 2008 approximately 1045 mountain daylight time, a Robinson R22 beta, M3056T, registered to Pacific Rim Aviation, Lafayette, Colorado, and operated by Premier Helicopters, Broomfield, Colorado, was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain following a loss of rotor rpm during a practice autorotation at Las Vegas Municipal Airport (LVS), Las Vegas, New Mexico. Visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed at the time of the accident. The cross-country instructional flight was being conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 without a flight plan. The commercial certificated flight instructor and student pilot on board the helicopter were not injured. The flight originated at Raton, New Mexico, at 0900, and was en route to Las Vegas, New Mexico.

According to the instructor's accident report, they checked both the terminal forecast (TAF) and the Automated Weather Observation Station (AWOS) for LVS. Both reported the wind to be from 020 degrees, but the TAF reported wind velocity to be 10 knots, whereas AWOS reported it to be 15 knots with gusts to 20 knots. As the helicopter approached the airport, the student told the instructor he would like to practice a 180 degree autorotation. The maneuver was begun from 1,000 feet agl (above ground level), but due to poor rpm and speed control, the instructor assumed control of the helicopter and advised the student he would demonstrate the proper technique. The instructor said he kept the rpm 'in the green' and kept the airspeed above 65 knots, but realized the helicopter was descending 'at an unusually high rate of descent.' As he rolled out to level, 'it felt as if we had a huge downdraft that was pushing us towards the ground.' The instructor added throttle and began to 'pull all the power available.' Lift was not sufficient to overcome the descent rate. Just prior to impact, the pilot applied slight aft cyclic control. The helicopter struck the ground, bounced, and continued to fly with some forward momentum. The instructor then landed the helicopter. Post-impact inspection revealed the skids were spread, the engine mounts were bent, and part of the pilot's window had popped out. The instructor said that at no time did the LOW ROTOR RPM horn sound.

Context: On October 17, 2018, a Robinson R22 Beta helicopter, N923SH, crashed near Fulton, Missouri, during a solo instructional flight, destroying the aircraft. The pilot, training for his rotorcraft-helicopter rating, was flying solo from Moscow Mills, Missouri, to Columbia Regional Airport, performing touch-and-go landings. The helicopter departed Moscow Mills around 1345 and crashed 36 minutes later en route to COU. Witnesses reported the helicopter losing altitude and spinning in a downward spiral, with no distress calls from the pilot. The pilot had a rotorcraft endorsement for solo flight in the R22 helicopter. The helicopter had 28 gallons of fuel onboard at departure, with the manufacturer indicating a consumption rate of 7-10 gallons per hour. The atmospheric conditions were conducive to moderate to serious icing. The wreckage was found in a grassy area near Fulton, MO, with evidence of a nose-low, left-skid-down impact.

Context: The pilot was conducting a night agricultural flight when an aggressive collective application during takeoff caused the engine to sputter and the RPMs to drop. Despite efforts to regain RPMs by lowering the collective, the helicopter descended and moved forward. The pilot applied aft cyclic to halt forward movement and attempted a landing. The left skid hit soft dirt, causing the main rotor blades to strike the tailboom as the pilot tried to prevent a nose-over. The helicopter rolled forward, spun left, and came to rest on its left side, causing substantial damage to the fuselage, tail rotor drive system, and skid tubes. The pilot admitted rushing the operation and confirmed no mechanical issues that would have hindered normal operation.

            Context: On March 4, 2008, a Bell 206L helicopter, N404EH, collided with terrain after losing control while maneuvering southeast of Nikolai, Alaska, causing substantial damage. The pilot was operating a visual flight rules (VFR) aerial photography flight under Title 14, CFR Part 91. The pilot and sole passenger sustained minor injuries. 

The pilot reported that while filming a dogsled race, a gust of wind caused a loss of tail rotor effectiveness, making the helicopter turn right. As he tried to regain control, the helicopter lost altitude and neared the terrain. A second gust caused further loss of tail rotor effectiveness, leading to the tail rotor hitting a tree and the helicopter crashing. The pilot confirmed no preimpact mechanical issues with the helicopter. The NTSB did not examine the helicopter.

            Context: On July 14, 2018, a Schweizer 269D Configuration A helicopter, N411HU, crashed near Stewartstown, Pennsylvania, causing substantial damage and minor injuries to the pilot and passenger. The pilot was flying towards Shoestring Aviation Airfield to land on runway 24, with wind from about 230 at 8-10 knots. The approach was normal until the pilot attempted to slow the helicopter. At an airspeed of 10-20 knots and 15-20 ft above ground, the helicopter began turning clockwise despite the pilot's application of left antitorque pedal. The helicopter spun in 360 circles, completing six to eight rotations before slowing, then accelerating again for another five to seven turns until it hit the ground. The pilot reported no audible alarms or change in engine sound.

A witness saw the helicopter hover at the end of the runway, rotate left, complete six to seven turns, pause, then start rotating again while drifting backward and losing altitude. The witness reported a constant engine sound throughout. 

Post-accident examination revealed substantial damage to the main and tail rotor blades, left fuselage, and horizontal stabilizer. Antitorque control continuity was confirmed, and the tail rotor control system responded appropriately with no binding noted. The tail rotor control cables had a tension of 58-59 lbs, slightly below the specified 60-65 lbs, but a manufacturer representative stated this would not affect control capability.

The Pilot's Flight Manual and FAA Advisory Circular 90-95 suggest the incident may have been a case of loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE), a low-speed aerodynamic flight characteristic that can result in uncommanded rapid yaw rate and potential loss of control.

            Context: The pilot reported a 'hard vibration' in the helicopter's controls while ascending from a canyon at 30 knots, approximately 50 ft above ground. He noticed the airspeed gauge read zero knots and felt a downward push. Despite no control input, the torque indicator rose to 120%.

            Context: On October 17, 2018, a Robinson R22 Beta helicopter, N923SH, crashed near Fulton, Missouri, during a solo instructional flight, destroying the aircraft. The pilot, training for his rotorcraft-helicopter rating, was flying solo from Moscow Mills, Missouri, to Columbia Regional Airport, performing touch-and-go landings. The helicopter departed Moscow Mills around 1345 and crashed 36 minutes later en route to COU. Witnesses reported the helicopter losing altitude and spinning in a downward spiral, with no distress calls from the pilot. The pilot had a rotorcraft endorsement for solo flight in the R22 helicopter. The helicopter had 28 gallons of fuel onboard at departure, with the manufacturer indicating a consumption rate of 7-10 gallons per hour. The atmospheric conditions were conducive to moderate to serious icing. The wreckage was found in a grassy area near Fulton, MO, with evidence of a nose-low, left-skid-down impact.

            Context: On March 4, 2008, a Bell 206L helicopter, N404EH, collided with terrain after losing control while maneuvering southeast of Nikolai, Alaska, causing substantial damage. The pilot was operating a visual flight rules (VFR) aerial photography flight under Title 14, CFR Part 91. The pilot and sole passenger sustained minor injuries. 

The pilot reported that while filming a dogsled race, a gust of wind caused a loss of tail rotor effectiveness, making the helicopter turn right. As he tried to regain control, the helicopter lost altitude and neared the terrain. A second gust caused further loss of tail rotor effectiveness, leading to the tail rotor hitting a tree and the helicopter crashing. The pilot confirmed no preimpact mechanical issues with the helicopter. The NTSB did not examine the helicopter.

            Context: The pilot of a Robinson R44 II was on the final leg of a VFR flight when he received a special VFR clearance due to snow showers. This clearance was later canceled due to 'saturation,' and the pilot was instructed not to enter the area. The pilot turned the helicopter around, entering a 'near zero/zero whiteout,' during which the attitude indicator 'tumbled.' Opting for a precautionary landing in a plowed field, the helicopter hit the ground, causing the skids to sink into the soft terrain and the tailboom and skids to separate from the fuselage. The weather at the destination airport reported 1 1/2 statute miles visibility in light snow and mist.

            Context: The pilot was conducting a night agricultural flight when an aggressive collective application during takeoff caused the engine to sputter and the RPMs to drop. Despite efforts to regain RPMs by lowering the collective, the helicopter descended and moved forward. The pilot applied aft cyclic to halt forward movement and attempted a landing. The left skid hit soft dirt, causing the main rotor blades to strike the tailboom as the pilot tried to prevent a nose-over. The helicopter rolled forward, spun left, and came to rest on its left side, causing substantial damage to the fuselage, tail rotor drive system, and skid tubes. The pilot admitted rushing the operation and confirmed no mechanical issues that would have hindered normal operation.

            Context: On March 18, 2008 approximately 1045 mountain daylight time, a Robinson R22 beta, M3056T, registered to Pacific Rim Aviation, Lafayette, Colorado, and operated by Premier Helicopters, Broomfield, Colorado, was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain following a loss of rotor rpm during a practice autorotation at Las Vegas Municipal Airport (LVS), Las Vegas, New Mexico. Visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed at the time of the accident. The cross-country instructional flight was being conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 without a flight plan. The commercial certificated flight instructor and student pilot on board the helicopter were not injured. The flight originated at Raton, New Mexico, at 0900, and was en route to Las Vegas, New Mexico.

According to the instructor's accident report, they checked both the terminal forecast (TAF) and the Automated Weather Observation Station (AWOS) for LVS. Both reported the wind to be from 020 degrees, but the TAF reported wind velocity to be 10 knots, whereas AWOS reported it to be 15 knots with gusts to 20 knots. As the helicopter approached the airport, the student told the instructor he would like to practice a 180 degree autorotation. The maneuver was begun from 1,000 feet agl (above ground level), but due to poor rpm and speed control, the instructor assumed control of the helicopter and advised the student he would demonstrate the proper technique. The instructor said he kept the rpm 'in the green' and kept the airspeed above 65 knots, but realized the helicopter was descending 'at an unusually high rate of descent.' As he rolled out to level, 'it felt as if we had a huge downdraft that was pushing us towards the ground.' The instructor added throttle and began to 'pull all the power available.' Lift was not sufficient to overcome the descent rate. Just prior to impact, the pilot applied slight aft cyclic control. The helicopter struck the ground, bounced, and continued to fly with some forward momentum. The instructor then landed the helicopter. Post-impact inspection revealed the skids were spread, the engine mounts were bent, and part of the pilot's window had popped out. The instructor said that at no time did the LOW ROTOR RPM horn sound.

            Context: On July 14, 2018, a Schweizer 269D Configuration A helicopter, N411HU, crashed near Stewartstown, Pennsylvania, causing substantial damage and minor injuries to the pilot and passenger. The pilot was flying towards Shoestring Aviation Airfield to land on runway 24, with wind from about 230 at 8-10 knots. The approach was normal until the pilot attempted to slow the helicopter. At an airspeed of 10-20 knots and 15-20 ft above ground, the helicopter began turning clockwise despite the pilot's application of left antitorque pedal. The helicopter spun in 360 circles, completing six to eight rotations before slowing, then accelerating again for another five to seven turns until it hit the ground. The pilot reported no audible alarms or change in engine sound.

A witness saw the helicopter hover at the end of the runway, rotate left, complete six to seven turns, pause, then start rotating again while drifting backward and losing altitude. The witness reported a constant engine sound throughout. 

Post-accident examination revealed substantial damage to the main and tail rotor blades, left fuselage, and horizontal stabilizer. Antitorque control continuity was confirmed, and the tail rotor control system responded appropriately with no binding noted. The tail rotor control cables had a tension of 58-59 lbs, slightly below the specified 60-65 lbs, but a manufacturer representative stated this would not affect control capability.

The Pilot's Flight Manual and FAA Advisory Circular 90-95 suggest the incident may have been a case of loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE), a low-speed aerodynamic flight characteristic that can result in uncommanded rapid yaw rate and potential loss of control.

            Context: The pilot was conducting a night agricultural flight when an aggressive collective application during takeoff caused the engine to sputter and the RPMs to drop. Despite efforts to regain RPMs by lowering the collective, the helicopter descended and moved forward. The pilot applied aft cyclic to halt forward movement and attempted a landing. The left skid hit soft dirt, causing the main rotor blades to strike the tailboom as the pilot tried to prevent a nose-over. The helicopter rolled forward, spun left, and came to rest on its left side, causing substantial damage to the fuselage, tail rotor drive system, and skid tubes. The pilot admitted rushing the operation and confirmed no mechanical issues that would have hindered normal operation.

            Context: On October 17, 2018, a Robinson R22 Beta helicopter, N923SH, crashed near Fulton, Missouri, during a solo instructional flight, destroying the aircraft. The pilot, training for his rotorcraft-helicopter rating, was flying solo from Moscow Mills, Missouri, to Columbia Regional Airport, performing touch-and-go landings. The helicopter departed Moscow Mills around 1345 and crashed 36 minutes later en route to COU. Witnesses reported the helicopter losing altitude and spinning in a downward spiral, with no distress calls from the pilot. The pilot had a rotorcraft endorsement for solo flight in the R22 helicopter. The helicopter had 28 gallons of fuel onboard at departure, with the manufacturer indicating a consumption rate of 7-10 gallons per hour. The atmospheric conditions were conducive to moderate to serious icing. The wreckage was found in a grassy area near Fulton, MO, with evidence of a nose-low, left-skid-down impact.

            Context: On July 14, 2018, a Schweizer 269D Configuration A helicopter, N411HU, crashed near Stewartstown, Pennsylvania, causing substantial damage and minor injuries to the pilot and passenger. The pilot was flying towards Shoestring Aviation Airfield to land on runway 24, with wind from about 230 at 8-10 knots. The approach was normal until the pilot attempted to slow the helicopter. At an airspeed of 10-20 knots and 15-20 ft above ground, the helicopter began turning clockwise despite the pilot's application of left antitorque pedal. The helicopter spun in 360 circles, completing six to eight rotations before slowing, then accelerating again for another five to seven turns until it hit the ground. The pilot reported no audible alarms or change in engine sound.

A witness saw the helicopter hover at the end of the runway, rotate left, complete six to seven turns, pause, then start rotating again while drifting backward and losing altitude. The witness reported a constant engine sound throughout. 

Post-accident examination revealed substantial damage to the main and tail rotor blades, left fuselage, and horizontal stabilizer. Antitorque control continuity was confirmed, and the tail rotor control system responded appropriately with no binding noted. The tail rotor control cables had a tension of 58-59 lbs, slightly below the specified 60-65 lbs, but a manufacturer representative stated this would not affect control capability.

The Pilot's Flight Manual and FAA Advisory Circular 90-95 suggest the incident may have been a case of loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE), a low-speed aerodynamic flight characteristic that can result in uncommanded rapid yaw rate and potential loss of control.

            Context: On a sunny afternoon, a small Cessna aircraft took off from the local airport for a routine training flight. The pilot, a seasoned instructor with over 20 years of experience, was accompanied by a student on his first flight. The weather was clear, with a light breeze coming from the west. The aircraft climbed steadily, reaching an altitude of 3000 feet. The instructor demonstrated a series of maneuvers, including turns, climbs, and descents. The student, eager to learn, watched closely and asked questions. After about an hour, the aircraft returned to the airport and landed safely. The student was thrilled with his first flight and looked forward to his next lesson.

            Context: On March 4, 2008, a Bell 206L helicopter, N404EH, collided with terrain after losing control while maneuvering southeast of Nikolai, Alaska, causing substantial damage. The pilot was operating a visual flight rules (VFR) aerial photography flight under Title 14, CFR Part 91. The pilot and sole passenger sustained minor injuries. 

The pilot reported that while filming a dogsled race, a gust of wind caused a loss of tail rotor effectiveness, making the helicopter turn right. As he tried to regain control, the helicopter lost altitude and neared the terrain. A second gust caused further loss of tail rotor effectiveness, leading to the tail rotor hitting a tree and the helicopter crashing. The pilot confirmed no preimpact mechanical issues with the helicopter. The NTSB did not examine the helicopter.

            Context: The pilot of a Robinson R44 II was on the final leg of a VFR flight when he received a special VFR clearance due to snow showers. This clearance was later canceled due to 'saturation,' and the pilot was instructed not to enter the area. The pilot turned the helicopter around, entering a 'near zero/zero whiteout,' during which the attitude indicator 'tumbled.' Opting for a precautionary landing in a plowed field, the helicopter hit the ground, causing the skids to sink into the soft terrain and the tailboom and skids to separate from the fuselage. The weather at the destination airport reported 1 1/2 statute miles visibility in light snow and mist.

            Context: The pilot reported a 'hard vibration' in the helicopter's controls while ascending from a canyon at 30 knots, approximately 50 ft above ground. He noticed the airspeed gauge read zero knots and felt a downward push. Despite no control input, the torque indicator rose to 120%. He maneuvered the helicopter downslope and into the wind, adjusting the controls to match the terrain. However, the helicopter hit the ground, with the skids and main rotor blades impacting first. It spun 180 degrees to the right before settling on its right side downhill, followed by a post-impact fire. The helicopter was destroyed in the fire. The pilot confirmed no pre-accident mechanical issues that could have hindered normal operation. He also noted gusty, frequently changing winds up to 30 knots in the canyon.

            Context: On March 18, 2008 approximately 1045 mountain daylight time, a Robinson R22 beta, M3056T, registered to Pacific Rim Aviation, Lafayette, Colorado, and operated by Premier Helicopters, Broomfield, Colorado, was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain following a loss of rotor rpm during a practice autorotation at Las Vegas Municipal Airport (LVS), Las Vegas, New Mexico. Visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed at the time of the accident. The cross-country instructional flight was being conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 without a flight plan. The commercial certificated flight instructor and student pilot on board the helicopter were not injured. The flight originated at Raton, New Mexico, at 0900, and was en route to Las Vegas, New Mexico.

According to the instructor's accident report, they checked both the terminal forecast (TAF) and the Automated Weather Observation Station (AWOS) for LVS. Both reported the wind to be from 020 degrees, but the TAF reported wind velocity to be 10 knots, whereas AWOS reported it to be 15 knots with gusts to 20 knots. As the helicopter approached the airport, the student told the instructor he would like to practice a 180 degree autorotation. The maneuver was begun from 1,000 feet agl (above ground level), but due to poor rpm and speed control, the instructor assumed control of the helicopter and advised the student he would demonstrate the proper technique. The instructor said he kept the rpm 'in the green' and kept the airspeed above 65 knots, but realized the helicopter was descending 'at an unusually high rate of descent.' As he rolled out to level, 'it felt as if we had a huge downdraft that was pushing us towards the ground.' The instructor added throttle and began to 'pull all the power available.' Lift was not sufficient to overcome the descent rate. Just prior to impact, the pilot applied slight aft cyclic control. The helicopter struck the ground, bounced, and continued to fly with some forward momentum. The instructor then landed the helicopter. Post-impact inspection revealed the skids were spread, the engine mounts were bent, and part of the pilot's window had popped out. The instructor said that at no time did the LOW ROTOR RPM horn sound.

The pilot reported that he had been applying dry fertilizer over trees as part of a timber company contract and had flown about 5.7 hours that day. As he was approaching the service truck to refill his bucket, about 40 ft above ground level and about 20 ft from the truck, the pilot experienced a 'jolt' and suddenly the helicopter 'dropped' to the sloping terrain below. The pilot stated he had no time to react and that the helicopter didn't turn or yaw after the 'jolt.' He did recall the torque gauge indicated between 85% and 90% during the accident sequence. The pilot further stated that everything on the helicopter had involuntarily shut down before he had exited. The witness that was manning the truck reported to the pilot didn't hear anything abnormal. He also stated that the wind was light and variable at the time of the accident.

The helicopter impacted the ground and came to rest on its side. The cabin area and windshield structure were bent and distorted. The tailboom separated near the midsection and the main rotor blades were buckled in multiple areas. 

The helicopter was recovered by the operator and secured at the operator's facility for further examination.

            Context: On October 17, 2018, a Robinson R22 Beta helicopter, N923SH, crashed near Fulton, Missouri, during a solo instructional flight, destroying the aircraft. The pilot, training for his rotorcraft-helicopter rating, was flying solo from Moscow Mills, Missouri, to Columbia Regional Airport, performing touch-and-go landings. The helicopter departed Moscow Mills around 1345 and crashed 36 minutes later en route to COU. Witnesses reported the helicopter losing altitude and spinning in a downward spiral, with no distress calls from the pilot. The pilot had a rotorcraft endorsement for solo flight in the R22 helicopter. The helicopter had 28 gallons of fuel onboard at departure, with the manufacturer indicating a consumption rate of 7-10 gallons per hour. The atmospheric conditions were conducive to moderate to serious icing. The wreckage was found in a grassy area near Fulton, MO, with evidence of a nose-low, left-skid-down impact.

            Context: On July 14, 2018, a Schweizer 269D Configuration A helicopter, N411HU, crashed near Stewartstown, Pennsylvania, causing substantial damage and minor injuries to the pilot and passenger. The pilot was flying towards Shoestring Aviation Airfield to land on runway 24, with wind from about 230 at 8-10 knots. The approach was normal until the pilot attempted to slow the helicopter. At an airspeed of 10-20 knots and 15-20 ft above ground, the helicopter began turning clockwise despite the pilot's application of left antitorque pedal. The helicopter spun in 360 circles, completing six to eight rotations before slowing, then accelerating again for another five to seven turns until it hit the ground. The pilot reported no audible alarms or change in engine sound.

A witness saw the helicopter hover at the end of the runway, rotate left, complete six to seven turns, pause, then start rotating again while drifting backward and losing altitude. The witness reported a constant engine sound throughout. 

Post-accident examination revealed substantial damage to the main and tail rotor blades, left fuselage, and horizontal stabilizer. Antitorque control continuity was confirmed, and the tail rotor control system responded appropriately with no binding noted. The tail rotor control cables had a tension of 58-59 lbs, slightly below the specified 60-65 lbs, but a manufacturer representative stated this would not affect control capability.

The Pilot's Flight Manual and FAA Advisory Circular 90-95 suggest the incident may have been a case of loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE), a low-speed aerodynamic flight characteristic that can result in uncommanded rapid yaw rate and potential loss of control.

The pilot was operating a visual flight rules (VFR) aerial photography flight under Title 14, CFR Part 91. The pilot and sole passenger sustained minor injuries. 

The pilot reported that while filming a dogsled race, a gust of wind caused a loss of tail rotor effectiveness, making the helicopter turn right. As he tried to regain control, the helicopter lost altitude and neared the terrain. A second gust caused further loss of tail rotor effectiveness, leading to the tail rotor hitting a tree and the helicopter crashing. The pilot confirmed no preimpact mechanical issues with the helicopter. The NTSB did not examine the helicopter.

            Context: The pilot reported a 'hard vibration' in the helicopter's controls while ascending from a canyon at 30 knots, approximately 50 ft above ground. He noticed the airspeed gauge read zero knots and felt a downward push. Despite no control input, the torque indicator rose to 120%. He maneuvered the helicopter downslope and into the wind, adjusting the controls to match the terrain. However, the helicopter hit the ground, with the skids and main rotor blades impacting first. It spun 180 degrees to the right before settling on its right side downhill, followed by a post-impact fire. The helicopter was destroyed in the fire. The pilot confirmed no pre-accident mechanical issues that could have hindered normal operation. He also noted gusty, frequently changing winds up to 30 knots in the canyon.

            Context: On March 18, 2008 approximately 1045 mountain daylight time, a Robinson R22 beta, M3056T, registered to Pacific Rim Aviation, Lafayette, Colorado, and operated by Premier Helicopters, Broomfield, Colorado, was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain following a loss of rotor rpm during a practice autorotation at Las Vegas Municipal Airport (LVS), Las Vegas, New Mexico. Visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed at the time of the accident. The cross-country instructional flight was being conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 without a flight plan. The commercial certificated flight instructor and student pilot on board the helicopter were not injured. The flight originated at Raton, New Mexico, at 0900, and was en route to Las Vegas, New Mexico.

According to the instructor's accident report, they checked both the terminal forecast (TAF) and the Automated Weather Observation Station (AWOS) for LVS. Both reported the wind to be from 020 degrees, but the TAF reported wind velocity to be 10 knots, whereas AWOS reported it to be 15 knots with gusts to 20 knots. As the helicopter approached the airport, the student told the instructor he would like to practice a 180 degree autorotation. The maneuver was begun from 1,000 feet agl (above ground level), but due to poor rpm and speed control, the instructor assumed control of the helicopter and advised the student he would demonstrate the proper technique. The instructor said he kept the rpm 'in the green' and kept the airspeed above 65 knots, but realized the helicopter was descending 'at an unusually high rate of descent.' As he rolled out to level, 'it felt as if we had a huge downdraft that was pushing us towards the ground.' The instructor added throttle and began to 'pull all the power available.' Lift was not sufficient to overcome the descent rate. Just prior to impact, the pilot applied slight aft cyclic control. The helicopter struck the ground, bounced, and continued to fly with some forward momentum. The instructor then landed the helicopter. Post-impact inspection revealed the skids were spread, the engine mounts were bent, and part of the pilot's window had popped out. The instructor said that at no time did the LOW ROTOR RPM horn sound.

The Pilot's Flight Manual and FAA Advisory Circular 90-95 suggest the incident may have been a case of loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE), a low-speed aerodynamic flight characteristic that can result in uncommanded rapid yaw rate and potential loss of control.

Output: [N411HU]

Context: On a sunny afternoon, a small Cessna aircraft took off from the local airport for a routine training flight. The pilot, a seasoned instructor with over 20 years of experience, was accompanied by a student on his first flight. The weather was clear, with a light breeze coming from the west. The aircraft climbed steadily, reaching an altitude of 3000 feet. The instructor demonstrated a series of maneuvers, including turns, climbs, and descents. The student, eager to learn, watched closely and asked questions. After about an hour, the aircraft returned to the airport and landed safely. The student was thrilled with his first flight and looked forward to his next lesson.

Output: [NONE]

Context: On March 18, 2008 approximately 1045 mountain daylight time, a Robinson R22 beta, M3056T, registered to Pacific Rim Aviation, Lafayette, Colorado, and operated by Premier Helicopters, Broomfield, Colorado, was substantially damaged when it impacted terrain following a loss of rotor rpm during a practice autorotation at Las Vegas Municipal Airport (LVS), Las Vegas, New Mexico. Visual meteorological conditions (VMC) prevailed at the time of the accident. The cross-country instructional flight was being conducted under the provisions of Title 14 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 91 without a flight plan. The commercial certificated flight instructor and student pilot on board the helicopter were not injured. The flight originated at Raton, New Mexico, at 0900, and was en route to Las Vegas, New Mexico.

According to the instructor's accident report, they checked both the terminal forecast (TAF) and the Automated Weather Observation Station (AWOS) for LVS. Both reported the wind to be from 020 degrees, but the TAF reported wind velocity to be 10 knots, whereas AWOS reported it to be 15 knots with gusts to 20 knots. As the helicopter approached the airport, the student told the instructor he would like to practice a 180 degree autorotation. The maneuver was begun from 1,000 feet agl (above ground level), but due to poor rpm and speed control, the instructor assumed control of the helicopter and advised the student he would demonstrate the proper technique. The instructor said he kept the rpm 'in the green' and kept the airspeed above 65 knots, but realized the helicopter was descending 'at an unusually high rate of descent.' As he rolled out to level, 'it felt as if we had a huge downdraft that was pushing us towards the ground.' The instructor added throttle and began to 'pull all the power available.' Lift was not sufficient to overcome the descent rate. Just prior to impact, the pilot applied slight aft cyclic control. The helicopter struck the ground, bounced, and continued to fly with some forward momentum. The instructor then landed the helicopter. Post-impact inspection revealed the skids were spread, the engine mounts were bent, and part of the pilot's window had popped out. The instructor said that at no time did the LOW ROTOR RPM horn sound.

Output: [M3056T]

Context: The pilot of a Robinson R44 II was on the final leg of a VFR flight when he received a special VFR clearance due to snow showers. This clearance was later canceled due to 'saturation,' and the pilot was instructed not to enter the area. The pilot turned the helicopter around, entering a 'near zero/zero whiteout,' during which the attitude indicator 'tumbled.' Opting for a precautionary landing in a plowed field, the helicopter hit the ground, causing the skids to sink into the soft terrain and the tailboom and skids to separate from the fuselage. The weather at the destination airport reported 1 1/2 statute miles visibility in light snow and mist.

Output: [NONE]

Context: On October 17, 2018, a Robinson R22 Beta helicopter, N923SH, crashed near Fulton, Missouri, during a solo instructional flight, destroying the aircraft. The pilot, training for his rotorcraft-helicopter rating, was flying solo from Moscow Mills, Missouri, to Columbia Regional Airport, performing touch-and-go landings. The helicopter departed Moscow Mills around 1345 and crashed 36 minutes later en route to COU. Witnesses reported the helicopter losing altitude and spinning in a downward spiral, with no distress calls from the pilot. The pilot had a rotorcraft endorsement for solo flight in the R22 helicopter. The helicopter had 28 gallons of fuel onboard at departure, with the manufacturer indicating a consumption rate of 7-10 gallons per hour. The atmospheric conditions were conducive to moderate to serious icing. The wreckage was found in a grassy area near Fulton, MO, with evidence of a nose-low, left-skid-down impact. 

Output: [N923SH]

Context: The pilot was conducting a night agricultural flight when an aggressive collective application during takeoff caused the engine to sputter and the RPMs to drop. Despite efforts to regain RPMs by lowering the collective, the helicopter descended and moved forward. The pilot applied aft cyclic to halt forward movement and attempted a landing. The left skid hit soft dirt, causing the main rotor blades to strike the tailboom as the pilot tried to prevent a nose-over. The helicopter rolled forward, spun left, and came to rest on its left side, causing substantial damage to the fuselage, tail rotor drive system, and skid tubes. The pilot admitted rushing the operation and confirmed no mechanical issues that would have hindered normal operation.

Output: [NONE]

Context: On March 4, 2008, a Bell 206L helicopter, N404EH, collided with terrain after losing control while maneuvering southeast of Nikolai, Alaska, causing substantial damage. The pilot was operating a visual flight rules (VFR) aerial photography flight under Title 14, CFR Part 91. The pilot and sole passenger sustained minor injuries. 

The pilot reported that while filming a dogsled race, a gust of wind caused a loss of tail rotor effectiveness, making the helicopter turn right. As he tried to regain control, the helicopter lost altitude and neared the terrain. A second gust caused further loss of tail rotor effectiveness, leading to the tail rotor hitting a tree and the helicopter crashing. The pilot confirmed no preimpact mechanical issues with the helicopter. The NTSB did not examine the helicopter.

Output: [N404EH]

Context: The pilot reported a 'hard vibration' in the helicopter's controls while ascending from a canyon at 30 knots, approximately 50 ft above ground. He noticed the airspeed gauge read zero knots and felt a downward push. Despite no control input, the torque indicator rose to 120%. He maneuvered the helicopter downslope and into the wind, adjusting the controls to match the terrain. However, the helicopter hit the ground, with the skids and main rotor blades impacting first. It spun 180 degrees to the right before settling on its right side downhill, followed by a post-impact fire. The helicopter was destroyed in the fire. The pilot confirmed no pre-accident mechanical issues that could have hindered normal operation. He also noted gusty, frequently changing winds up to 30 knots in the canyon.

Context: On July 14, 2018, a Schweizer 269D Configuration A helicopter, N411HU, crashed near Stewartstown, Pennsylvania, causing substantial damage and minor injuries to the pilot and passenger. The pilot was flying towards Shoestring Aviation Airfield to land on runway 24, with wind from about 230 at 8-10 knots. The approach was normal until the pilot attempted to slow the helicopter. At an airspeed of 10-20 knots and 15-20 ft above ground, the helicopter began turning clockwise despite the pilot's application of left antitorque pedal. The helicopter spun in 360 circles, completing six to eight rotations before slowing, then accelerating again for another five to seven turns until it hit the ground. The pilot reported no audible alarms or change in engine sound.

A witness saw the helicopter hover at the end of the runway, rotate left, complete six to seven turns, pause, then start rotating again while drifting backward and losing altitude. The witness reported a constant engine sound throughout. 

Post-accident examination revealed substantial damage to the main and tail rotor blades, left fuselage, and horizontal stabilizer. Antitorque control continuity was confirmed, and the tail rotor control system responded appropriately with no binding noted. The tail rotor control cables had a tension of 58-59 lbs, slightly below the specified 60-65 lbs, but a manufacturer representative stated this would not affect control capability.

The Pilot's Flight Manual and FAA Advisory Circular 90-95 suggest the incident may have been a case of loss of tail rotor effectiveness (LTE), a low-speed aerodynamic flight characteristic that can result in uncommanded rapid yaw rate and potential loss of control.

Output: [N411HU]
